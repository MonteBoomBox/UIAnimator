## Installation Guide
The installation of UIAnimator is very simple. Just download the Unity Package [here](https://github.com/MonteBoomBox/UIAnimator/releases/latest). 
1. Import the `UIAnimator.unitypackage` as a Custom Package in the `Assets` folder.
2. Leave everything as is and click on `Import`
3. This will generate a new folder called `UIAnimator`. Inside this folder you can find the scripts for Position, Scale and Color Animation.
4. Just drag and drop the required script on any UI element inside your `Canvas`

UIAnimator is a designer-friendly tool! So it is very easy for anyone to understand the script and start making their own awesome UI animations. Tweak the values in the Inspector according to your needs. And voila! Your UI Animation is now working in all it's glory.

## Attribution Required??
There is no need for attribution for this tool (But would be greatly appreciated :)). You are free to use this tool in non-commercial and commercial projects for completely free! 

## Development Plan

There are some additions which would be added to UIAnimator soon. It is currently just a side-project I have. But I will be solving issues and bringing small updates to it. If you have any suggestions, create a issue about it with the `Suggestion` tag. I will try my best to add them.

## Purpose of UIAnimator
UI Tweening is a method of animating UI, so you don't have to use Animation and burn your PC. Until now all the UI Tweening libraries I have seen take time to learn and use in your project. I wanted to create a simple and easy-to-use UI Tweening library that any Unity user can pickup and start using instantly. And that's how UIAnimator was made. The usage of UIAnimator is designer-friendly which makes it super easy to work with.
